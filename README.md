# Task Manager 📋

Using Laravel and VueJs design and implement an appointment module that does the following:

- Employee can set their availability e.g available on weekdays 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM weekend half day.
- Assign an employee a task when they are available.
- employee can login and see the tasks assigned.
